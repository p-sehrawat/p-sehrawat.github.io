            <h1>Spider-Man</h1>
            <p>Bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter Parker's arachnid abilities give him amazing powers he uses to help others, while his personal life continues to offer plenty of obstacles. Spiderman's popularity can be attributed to a multitude of factors, from his iconic design to the different ways he has been marketed over the years. When Stan Lee and Steve Dikto first created this character, they had no idea how long the series would go on or how well fans would receive the young hero.</p>

            <h1>Iron-Man</span></h1>
            <p>The Mark I Iron Man Armor was Tony Stark's first Iron Man suit, built to help him escape from forced captivity by the Ten Rings. The suit was crafted from the limited resources around him, including salvaged pieces of scrap metal and machine parts. That was how Tony Stark came to be known as Iron-Man. Tony played a key role in defeating any number of villains over the course of the films, starting with Iron Monger and ending with Thanos, but in the end none of this is what makes him the greatest Avenger. What makes him great is the change he underwent as a person.</p>

            <h1>Captain America</h1>
            <p>After being infused with the Super-Soldier serum, Steve Roger's body reached the upper-most limits of human perfection in strength, stamina, agility, and durability. With training, he learned to use these traits in perfect unison in any given situation. He's heroic from the word go, and therefore, unquestionably the greatest. Once he becomes Captain America, Steve Rogers remains humble and is willing to do whatever it takes for the greater good of the war effort, even if it means appearing in banal, somewhat humiliating theatrical war bond fundraising endeavours.</p>

            <h1>Hulk</h1>
            <p>Bruce Banner was accidentally bombarded with gamma rays from a "gamma bomb" he had invented. Banner continued to look like a normal human being, but when angered he would transform into the Hulk, a raging giant with green skin and super strength. Hulk is more realistic is the reason he is popular. Banner is a scientist who wants to help people with his research. The army is using him but he becomes hulk and his life is like hell and he is the king of hell. He looses everything and all he wants to do is become human again.he is not hurting anyone wants to live peacefully but others won't let him. The army the power hungry people hunt him target him and he tries to control the monster inside to the last human limit.</p>

            <h1>Black Widow</h1>
            <p>Trained at a facility called the Red Room, Natasha was also enhanced with the Soviets' version of the Super-Soldier serum, gifting her with peak human strength and stamina, as well as resistance to disease and slowed-down aging. Her fierce spirit and strength has grown under years of training. She is not as strong as Hulk or Thor, as durable as Captain America and she also does not have the incredible marksmanship that Hawkeye does. Nonetheless, she's always been pivotal in helping the Avengers save the Earth.</p>
